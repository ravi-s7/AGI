# Gitignore Generator for VS Code

A VS Code extension that automatically generates and updates `.gitignore` files based on auto-detected and manually selected technologies.

## Features

- **Auto-detection**: Automatically detects technologies used in your workspace
- **Smart updates**: Append or overwrite existing `.gitignore` files
- **Comprehensive templates**: Uses [gitignore.io](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore) API to fetch the latest templates
- **Customizable**: Add your own detection rules for technologies

![Demo Usage](https://via.placeholder.com/800x450.png?text=Gitignore+Generator+Demo)

## Installation

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Search for "Gitignore Generator"
4. Click Install

## Usage

1. Open a workspace in VS Code
2. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
3. Type "Generate/Update .gitignore" and select the command
4. Select technologies from the list (auto-detected technologies will be pre-selected)
5. Choose to append or overwrite if a `.gitignore` file already exists

## Auto-detected Technologies

The extension can automatically detect many common technologies including:

- Node.js, Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, .NET, Go, Rust
- Angular, React, Vue (via package.json dependencies)
- Docker, VS Code, JetBrains IDEs
- Flutter, Dart, Kotlin, Swift, and more

## Configuration

You can add custom detection rules in your VS Code settings:

```json
"gitignoreGenerator.customDetectionMap": [
  {
    "tech": "mytech",
    "indicator": "myfile.txt"
  },
  {
    "tech": "othertechnology",
    "indicator": ["file1.txt", "file2.txt"]
  }
]
```

## How It Works

1. The extension scans your workspace for indicator files
2. Technologies are detected based on file presence (e.g., package.json = Node.js)
3. Detected technologies are presented in a QuickPick dialog
4. Selected technologies are used to fetch appropriate gitignore rules
5. The extension either creates, overwrites, or updates your `.gitignore` file
